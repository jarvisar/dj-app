# dj-app

The app serves as a collaborative queue management system for DJs at parties, allowing them to create a new queue and receive a unique four-digit code. Partygoers can join the queue by entering the code on their app and use the Spotify API to search and add songs to the queue. The app keeps track of the number of requests for each song, creating a crowd-sourced playlist for the DJ to play.
